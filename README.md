My First Program to Brute Force Emails , Just Run it and provide it with SMTP Server and port and enjoy
while it brute forces the passwords, Of course it only works if the password is dictionary based.
I advise to try as Many accounts in a time as you could to yield best results.
Remember the Attack is as good as the Dictionary that you are using.

Current Features :

-Multiple Accounts At a Time
-Multiple Threads ( Chosen By User )
-No external Libraries required
-Native Console Interface
-Resumes after closing / Can Start New Scan
